CRITICALS:
- bitmap should returns values in growing order

ENHANCEMENTS:
- currently using a lot of double linked list, should implement a lib to handle all this, with some cool macros like https://litux.nl/mirror/kerneldevelopment/0672327201/app01lev1sec2.html
- VMM shouldn't panic itself, returns errors, I like the functional way of doing it, so like Rust with a Result<Ok, Err>
- implement tests/vmm.c
- care about alignment
- stack trace on panics
- not fond of all the type casts, find your way
- adjust KHEAP_START and KHEAP_STOP dynamically, or maybe just don't use them
- remove all u64 u32 etc.. types and use the types created by the compiler

FEATURES:
- handle multiple cores
- switch from VGA to frame buffer
- make really easy to make program that draw things to screen
- ANSI console && printk shouldn't depend on VGA
- USB driver would be really cool
- NVMe driver lol, base spec is 700 pages
